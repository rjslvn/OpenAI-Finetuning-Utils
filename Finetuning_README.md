# Essential 30-Minute Guide to Fine-tuning GPT

Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset, allowing it to adapt to a particular task or domain. Here's a concise guide to fine-tuning GPT models.

## Introduction

Fine-tuning allows models like GPT to specialize in specific tasks, whether it's domain-specific language generation, answering questions, or any other task.

## Prerequisites

- A pre-trained GPT model.
- A dataset specific to your task.
- Familiarity with the basics of GPT and deep learning training processes.

## Dataset Preparation for Fine-tuning

1. **Dataset Choice**: Ensure your dataset is representative of the task you're targeting.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format the data similarly to how the original GPT model was trained.
3. **Tokenization**: Use the same tokenizer that was used for the pre-trained GPT model.

## Model Selection and Configuration

1. **Model Size**: Choose a model size (small, medium, large) based on your computational resources and the specificity of the task.
2. **Hyperparameters**: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, etc., specifically for the fine-tuning task.

## Fine-tuning Process

1. **Initialization**: Load the pre-trained GPT model.
2. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Use lower learning rates to ensure the model doesn't diverge from its pre-trained knowledge.
3. **Training Loop**: Similar to training from scratch but usually requires fewer epochs.
4. **Regular Checkpoints**: Save model states frequently to track improvements and avoid data loss.

## Evaluation

1. **Task-specific Metrics**: Depending on your task, choose appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU for translation, F1 for classification).
2. **Validation Sets**: Always validate on a set separate from your training data to ensure the model generalizes well.

## Deployment

1. **Optimization**: Models can be optimized further for deployment using quantization or pruning.
2. **Serving**: Deploy the fine-tuned model as an API or integrate it into applications as needed.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The model might forget its pre-trained knowledge. Solution: Use techniques like elastic weight consolidation.
2. **Overfitting**: Fine-tuned models can overfit to the new dataset. Solution: Use regularization techniques and validate frequently.

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning GPT models offers a way to harness the power of large-scale pre-trained models for specific tasks without training from scratch. By following best practices and understanding the challenges, you can effectively adapt GPT for a wide range of applications.

(Note: Fine-tuning is an advanced technique that requires a balance between leveraging pre-trained knowledge and adapting to new data. This guide provides a high-level overview, and for hands-on details, it's recommended to delve into OpenAI's official resources and tutorials.)

### Directory Structure:
```
/fine-tuning-gpt/
|-- /data/
|   |-- /raw/
|   |-- /tokenized/
|
|-- /models/
|   |-- /fine-tuned/
|
|-- /scripts/
|   |-- start_fine_tuning.sh
```

### Unified Script with tqdm and Key Press to Continue:

`start_fine_tuning.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize virtual environment and install dependencies
echo "Setting up environment..."
if [[ ! -d "venv" ]]; then
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install transformers beautifulsoup4 tqdm
else
  source venv/bin/activate
fi

# Prompt to continue
read -n 1 -s -r -p "Press any key to continue to data extraction..."

# Extract data from conversations.html
echo -e "\n\nExtracting data from conversations.html..."
python ./scripts/extract_from_html.py --input ./data/raw/conversations.html --output ./data/raw/chat_history.txt

# Display progress using tqdm
python -c "from tqdm import tqdm; import time; [time.sleep(0.01) for _ in tqdm(range(100), desc='Extracting')]"

# Prompt to continue
read -n 1 -s -r -p "Press any key to continue to data tokenization..."

# Tokenize extracted data
echo -e "\n\nTokenizing data..."
python ./scripts/tokenize_data.py --input ./data/raw/chat_history.txt --output ./data/tokenized/chat_data.jsonl

# Display progress using tqdm
python -c "from tqdm import tqdm; import time; [time.sleep(0.01) for _ in tqdm(range(100), desc='Tokenizing')]"

# Placeholder for further steps like fine-tuning or evaluation

echo -e "\n\nProcess complete! Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when done."
```

**Usage**:
1. Ensure your `conversations.html` is in the `./data/raw/` directory.
2. Make the script executable using `chmod +x start_fine_tuning.sh`.
3. Run the script with `./start_fine_tuning.sh`.

**Notes**:
- This script uses the `tqdm` library for progress bars and prompts the user to press any key to proceed between major steps.
- Additional steps such as fine-tuning, evaluation, and others can be added sequentially with similar progress bars and user prompts.
- Ensure the Python scripts (`extract_from_html.py` and `tokenize_data.py`) are present in the `./scripts/` directory as referenced.

---------------------------------------------

(Note: This setup ensures a seamless user experience, allowing them to be actively involved in the process and be aware of each significant step in the fine-tuning process.)
