## Introduction

OpenAI's models, particularly the GPT series, offer state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks. However, to harness their full potential for specific applications, fine-tuning becomes essential. This repository provides a set of tools and scripts that simplify the fine-tuning process, making it accessible to both newcomers and seasoned ML practitioners.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rjslvn/OpenAI-Finetuning-Utils.git
cd OpenAI-Finetuning-Utils
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extract chat data seamlessly from various formats including HTML exports.
- **Tokenization Utilities**: Tokenize datasets in a format compatible with OpenAI models.
- **Training Scripts**: Fine-tune models with custom datasets using pre-configured or custom training loops.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Assess model performance with metrics tailored for specific tasks.

## Usage

### 1. Data Extraction:
Place your raw data, such as `conversations.html`, into the `./data/raw/` directory. Use the `data_extraction.py` script to process and format the data.

### 2. Tokenization:
Use the `tokenize_data.py` script to tokenize the extracted data, making it ready for training.

### 3. Fine-tuning:
Run the `fine_tune_model.py` script to start the fine-tuning process. You can adjust hyperparameters and settings as needed.

### 4. Evaluation:
Once fine-tuning is complete, use the `evaluate_model.py` script to measure the model's performance on validation datasets.
